## Implementation Approach and Efficiency Considerations

### create_matrices.f90
When constructing the Helmholtz operator 𝐻, I faced a choice between using BLAS subroutine `DGEMM` to directly compute 𝐻 = 𝛼²𝐷𝑥ᵀ𝐷𝑥 + 𝐼 versus iterating through matrix elements. I chose the former approach because:

- It reduces code complexity
- Leverages optimized BLAS routines for matrix-matrix multiplication
- Allows transposing 𝐷𝑥 within the `DGEMM` call, eliminating the need for separate transpose operations
- Minimizes computational overhead

### helmholtz_solve.f90
This implementation exploits the SPD (Symmetric Positive Definite) property of 𝐻 (established in Part III Q1) by using LAPACK's `DPOSV` subroutine, which employs Cholesky decomposition. Key advantages:

- Reduced computational complexity compared to general solvers like `DGESV`
- Eliminates need for pivoting
- Includes error checking via the `info` variable for robust debugging

### test_helmholtz.f90
Following the provided guidelines, I implemented this validation subroutine with optimizations:

- Used `DNRM2` from BLAS for norm calculation ‖𝜼 − 𝜼𝒊𝒏‖₂ instead of manual implementation
- Employed `DGEMV` for matrix-vector multiplication 𝒓 = 𝐻𝜼𝒊𝒏
- Leveraged optimized library routines for better performance

### timestepping.f90
Faithfully implemented Algorithm 1 with efficiency considerations:

- Used single `DGEMV` calls for vector updates (e.g., 𝒖 = 𝒖 − 𝜈𝐷𝑥𝜼′)
- Computed (𝜈)(𝐷𝑥𝜼) instead of ((𝜈)𝐷𝑥)𝜼 to minimize FLOPs
- Maximized use of BLAS/LAPACK routines throughout

### shallow_water.f90
Enhanced the provided skeleton by:

1. Adding `test_helmholtz` call for validation
2. Ensuring proper allocation/deallocation of memory
3. Verifying correct variable passing between subroutines

### General Efficiency Practices
- Minimized temporary variables
- Avoided unnecessary declarations
- Maintained awareness of variable usage patterns
- Prioritized library routines over custom implementations for optimized performance

## Banded Matrix Implementation

### create_banded_matrices.f90
My approach directly allocates elements to their appropriate locations in the banded structure, which offers several advantages:

- Efficient storage: 4×𝑛 for 𝐻̂ and 2×𝑛 for 𝐷𝑥 instead of 𝑛×𝑛
- Enables use of banded-specific LAPACK/BLAS routines (`DGBSV`, `DGBMV`)
- Eliminates need for DO loops through direct allocation (e.g., 𝐻̂(2,:) = −𝛼²)
- Avoids full matrix representation while maintaining mathematical equivalence

### banded_helmholtz_solve.f90
This implementation closely follows the section 1.3 methodology:

- Uses `DGBSV` for banded matrix solving, significantly reducing FLOP count
- Includes comprehensive error checking for robust operation
- While potentially recalculating ℎ and 𝑤 could be optimized, the current implementation maintains correctness

### test_helmholtz.f90
The validation approach mirrors Part I's methodology:

- Computes norm ‖𝜼𝒊𝒏 − 𝜼‖₂ after processing through banded_helmholtz_solve
- Provides reasonable verification though potentially not the most comprehensive test
- Maintains consistency with the established testing pattern

## Overall Efficiency Gains
The banded implementation provides substantial efficiency improvements through:

1. **Reduced storage requirements**: O(𝑛) vs O(𝑛²)
2. **Specialized algorithms**: Banded-specific solvers with lower computational complexity
3. **Memory efficiency**: Minimized data movement and storage overhead
4. **Maintained mathematical integrity**: Equivalent results with optimized computation

# Improved Timestepping Method - Report

## Banded Matrix Optimization

In the updated `timestepping_improved.f90` implementation, I leveraged specialized LAPACK and BLAS subroutines optimized for banded matrices:

- **DGBMV**: Used for computing solutions to banded matrix equations $\hat{D_x} \boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{b}$
- **DGBSV**: Employed in `banded_helmholtz_solve.f90` for efficient linear solves
- These routines are specifically designed for banded structures, providing theoretical computational efficiency gains

## Algorithmic Enhancements

### Vector Computation Optimization
For updating vectors $\boldsymbol{u}$, $\boldsymbol{r}$ in Algorithm 1 (lines [2], [3], [7]), I implemented a targeted approach:

- **Analysis**: Recognized that the dot product $\boldsymbol{d_2}(\boldsymbol{d_1}^T \boldsymbol{\eta})$ produces a vector with only one non-zero element
- **Implementation**: Instead of performing full vector operations, I isolated the specific affected element
- **Example**: In line [2], after `DGBMV` computes $\boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{u} - \nu\theta\hat{D_x}\boldsymbol{\eta}$, I specifically update:
  ```fortran
  u(n) = u(n) - νθ·η(1)
